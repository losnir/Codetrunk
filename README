   Codetrunk
================

Codetrunk.com is a platform for sharing code snippets with friends, co-workers, pepole on irc channels and, in fact, with everyone on the Internet.
Codetrunk is my little project for making a better pastebin, with the abbility of commenting on trunks (or bins), revising and so on.
The main idea was to implement a better syntax highlighter (SyntaxHighlighter) with a prettier (but heavier) interface, something which pastebin was lacking.
Codetrunk is also an effort of mine to improve my php coding skills, therefore, the software behind Codetrunk implemnts the following:

    * Model View Controller Design Pattern
    * Singleton Design Pattern
    * Database-less Design to improve performance & reliability - while maintaining efficiency.

The latest version can always be found live at http://wwww.codetrunk.com.
Additionally, the most updated version could be found at Google Code SVN's, here: http://code.google.com/p/codetrunk/source/browse/trunk

Beaware that the latest version at the svn might not be suitable for production needs and might be unstable, therefore you should only use the version that is downloadable
from Google Code website.
